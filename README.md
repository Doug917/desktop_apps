# desktop_apps

Simple office apps.

pdf_to_xls_app is an example of using python to scrape a pdf customer order
into an excel spreadsheet.  The regex code is specific to the particular
customer order files I was scraping which have personal information and
therefore are not included.

excel_merge takes as input the paths to two excel files
and merges them (inner join) on user-specified key columns.
The application is an alternative to repeated using excel's
Vlookup function.

RGB_codes converts RGB triplet to hexcode and shows a color sample.
